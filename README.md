**NSoup is currently unmaintained.**

At this time, I am not actively working on this library. However, I will happily accept any help and pull requests, and perhaps return to working on it, should it gain any more traction.

The source code has been migrated from CodePlex in the hopes it will get picked up by the GitHub community. It is by now fairly outdated and perhaps should be ported from latest *jsoup* scratch.

# NSoup
NSoup is a .NET port of the jsoup (https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) HTML parser and sanitizer originally written in Java.

jsoup originally written by [Jonathan Hedley](https://github.com/jhy).
