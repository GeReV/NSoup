(2013-07-10) In the last few months I've been struggling with a few tests crashing for some reason I cannot isolate. I've pushed the latest version of the source code, and if anyone can help solve those issues it would greatly help this project.

## Features

- jQuery-like CSS selectors for finding and extracting data from HTML pages.
- Sanitize HTML sent from untrusted sources.
- Manipulate HTML documents.
